        "The Shawshank Redemption" is a movie about time,
        patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps,
        but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story,
        which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends
        and find a way to fight off despair.

        The story is narrated by "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman),
        who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison
        for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur.
        He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy,
        even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use.
        One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of
        prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry
        during their first night in prison, and who will not.
        Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),
        who looks like a babe in the woods.
